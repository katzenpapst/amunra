== Version 0.3.3 ==
- Shuttles can be crafted with extra fuel tanks instead of chests. Each tank increases the fuel capacity by 50%
- Added Shuttle Docks: in a sense, a vertical version of the rocket launch pad for shuttle rockets. The dock can be placed into a wall, shuttles can be deployed from and withdrawn into item form, and can be entered through the GUI. On Motherships and space stations, Shuttles will attempt to dock at the first available dock.

- made engines indestructible while in transit

== Version 0.3.0
- reworked engines: 
-- old: use the speed of the slowest valid engine and check if the total thrust is larger than the ship's mass
-- new: the thrust is now an actual force value in Newtons. The total thrust force and the mass of the ship are then used to calculate the acceleration of the ship, and from this the speed and the travel time. 
-- The fuel usage is still a fixed value, the engine must have enough fuel to burn the entire duration of the transit

== Version 0.2.11 ==
- rebalanced/fixed transit between solar systems. other solar systems are now way closer, and mothership engines consume more fuel per AU. Sol and Ra are now about 13 AU apart.

- potentially fixed respawn point on motherships
- /mothership_move command: a cheat to move the mothership in constant time without needing fuel. You need to be on a mothership and use it like "/mothership_move overworld"
- /find_celestial_body command: will search registered celestial bodies by the localized name and return the internal name (for configs, or /mothership_move). Output is in the format: "<localized name> : <body name>"
- fixed mothership creation in true multiplayer
